    - [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) (for macos you can use `brew`)
    - [coreutils](https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/)

Write code according to [I&A module standards](https://aws-ia.github.io/standards-terraform/).

## Module documentation in README.md

Do not manually update `README.md`. Instead, edit [.header.md](./.header.md) and then run `terraform-docs ./` or allow the `pre-commit` to do so.

## Terratest

Please include tests to validate your examples/<> root modules, at a minimum. This can be accomplished with usually only slight modifications to the [boilerplate test provided in this template](./test/examples_basic_test.go)

### Configure and run Terratest

1. Install

    [golang](https://go.dev/doc/install) (for macos you can use `brew`)
2. Change directory into the test folder.

    `cd test`
3. Initialize your test

    go mod init github.com/[github org]/[repository]

    `go mod init github.com/aws-ia/terraform-aws-vpc`
4. Run tidy

    `git mod tidy`
5. Install Terratest

    `go get github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest/modules/terraform`
6. Run test (You can have multiple test files).
    - Run all tests

        `go test`
    - Run a specific test with a timeout

        `go test -run examples_basic_test.go -timeout 45m`
## Module Standards

For best practices and information on developing with Terraform, see the [I&A Module Standards](https://aws-ia.github.io/standards-terraform/)

## Continuous Integration

The I&A team uses AWS CodeBuild to perform continuous integration (CI) within the organization. Our CI uses the a repo's `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file as well as some other checks. All PRs with other CI will be rejected. See our [FAQ](https://aws-ia.github.io/standards-terraform/faq/#are-modules-protected-by-ci-automation) for more details.
